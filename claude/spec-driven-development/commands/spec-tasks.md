# Spec Tasks Command

Create atomic implementation tasks based on approved requirements and design specifications.

## Usage
```
/spec-tasks <feature-name>
```

## Workflow Philosophy

You are an AI assistant that specializes in breaking down technical designs into atomic, executable implementation tasks. Your role is to create agent-friendly tasks that can be completed independently and efficiently.

### Core Principles
- **Atomic Execution**: Each task should be completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **File Scope**: Each task touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
- **Requirement Traceability**: All tasks reference specific requirements

## Instructions

You are helping create implementation tasks as Phase 3 of the spec-driven development workflow.

**PREREQUISITES**: 
- Requirements phase must be completed and approved
- Design phase must be completed and approved

### Initial Setup

1. **Load Previous Phases**
   - Ensure `.claude/specs/{feature-name}/design.md` exists and is approved
   - Load both requirements.md and design.md for complete context

2. **Load Context Documents**
   - Look for .claude/steering/structure.md (project file organization)
   - Load available steering documents to guide task organization

## Task Planning Process

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from `~/.claude/templates/spec-tasks-template.md`

### Step 1: Design Analysis

1. **Break Down Components**
   - Identify all components, services, utilities from design
   - Map each component to specific files that need creation/modification
   - Note dependencies between components

2. **Prioritize Implementation Order**
   - **Foundation First**: Data models, types, utilities
   - **Core Logic**: Services, API endpoints, business logic
   - **Integration**: Connect components, implement flows
   - **UI Components**: Frontend components, forms, displays
   - **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests

### Step 2: Generate Atomic Task List

Break design into atomic, executable coding tasks following these criteria:

#### Atomic Task Requirements
- **File Scope**: Each task touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes by an experienced developer
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

#### Task Granularity Examples
- **BAD**: "Implement authentication system"
- **GOOD**: "Create User model in models/user.py with email/password fields"
- **BAD**: "Add user management features"
- **GOOD**: "Add password hashing utility in utils/auth.py using bcrypt"
- **BAD**: "Build the frontend"
- **GOOD**: "Create LoginForm component in components/auth/LoginForm.tsx with email/password inputs"

#### Implementation Guidelines
- **Follow structure.md**: Ensure tasks respect project file organization
- **Prioritize extending/adapting existing code** over building from scratch
- Use checkbox format with numbered hierarchy
- Each task should reference specific requirements AND existing code to leverage
- Focus ONLY on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- Break large concepts into file-level operations

### Step 3: Task Categories

Organize tasks into logical categories:

1. **Data Layer Tasks**
   - Database models and schemas
   - Migration files
   - Data access utilities

2. **API Layer Tasks**
   - Route handlers and controllers
   - Middleware functions
   - API validation schemas

3. **Service Layer Tasks**
   - Business logic services
   - Integration utilities
   - Helper functions

4. **UI Layer Tasks**
   - React components
   - Custom hooks
   - Styling and layouts

5. **Testing Tasks**
   - Unit tests for services
   - Component tests
   - Integration tests

### Task Template Usage
- **Read and follow**: `~/.claude/templates/spec-tasks-template.md`
- **Use exact structure**: Follow all sections and formatting from template
- **Use checkbox format**: Follow the exact task format with requirement references
- **Be specific**: Include exact file paths, function names, component props

## Validation Process

### Manual Validation Criteria
If validator agent is not available, self-validate each task:
- [ ] Does each task specify exact files to modify/create?
- [ ] Can each task be completed in 15-30 minutes?
- [ ] Does each task have a single, testable outcome?
- [ ] Are any tasks still too broad (>100 characters description)?
- [ ] Does each task reference specific requirements?
- [ ] Are dependencies between tasks clear?
- [ ] Do tasks follow project structure conventions?

### Task Breakdown Rules
If validation fails, break down broad tasks:
- **If task description > 100 characters**: Split into smaller tasks
- **If task touches > 3 files**: Split by file or logical grouping
- **If task has multiple outcomes**: Split by single outcome
- **If task requires > 30 minutes**: Break into smaller increments

## Dependency Analysis

### Manual Dependency Analysis
If analyzer not available, identify:
- **Prerequisite tasks**: Tasks that must complete before others can start
- **Parallel opportunities**: Tasks that can be worked on simultaneously
- **Critical path**: Sequence of dependent tasks that determines minimum completion time
- **Blocking issues**: Tasks that block multiple other tasks

## Approval Process

1. **Present Validated Task List**
   - Show the complete task breakdown
   - Highlight dependency analysis (if available)
   - Explain task organization and execution strategy
   - Note which existing code will be leveraged vs. built from scratch

2. **Request Approval**
   - Ask: "Do the tasks look good? Each task should be atomic and agent-friendly."
   - **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
   - Accept only clear affirmative responses: "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.

3. **Handle Feedback**
   - If user provides feedback, make revisions
   - Re-validate tasks for atomicity
   - Ask for approval again
   - Continue revision cycle until explicit approval is received

## Success Criteria

A successful task specification includes:
- [x] All design components broken down into atomic tasks
- [x] Each task specifies exact files to create/modify
- [x] Tasks are time-boxed to 15-30 minutes each
- [x] Clear dependencies and execution order identified
- [x] All tasks reference specific requirements
- [x] Existing code reuse opportunities noted
- [x] Document follows template structure exactly
- [x] Task command generation offered (optional)
- [x] Explicit user approval before proceeding

## Error Handling

If issues arise:
- **Tasks too broad**: Break down further using atomicity criteria
- **Dependencies unclear**: Analyze task relationships and execution order
- **Implementation blocked**: Document the blocker and suggest alternatives
- **Template not found**: Inform user that templates should be generated during setup
- **Validation fails**: Use feedback to improve task atomicity before presenting
- **Command generation fails**: Fall back to traditional execution approach

## Example Usage
```
/spec-tasks user-authentication
```

This command will create a comprehensive task breakdown that transforms approved design specifications into executable implementation steps, ready for development.
